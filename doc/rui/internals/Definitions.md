## Definitions

#### component

A *component* is a class that extends `RuiFragment` and has its own *component state*. The
state may be empty. The compiler plugin generates components from *original functions*.
It is also possible to manually write a component, actually most low-level components
that interact with the underlying UI are written manually.

#### original function

An *original function* is a function the UI programmer writes and is annotated with `@Rui`.
The compiler plugin turns original functions into a *components*.

#### structural

A *structural* is a general building block used by *components* to build the structure of
the rendered UI. These are pre-defined by the Rui runtime: `RuiBlock`, `RuiWhen`,
`RuiLoop`. Structurals do not have a state, they use the state of the component they are
defined in when deciding how to render the UI.

#### fragment

A *fragment* is a *component* or a *structural*. Fragments are the building blocks of
the runtime Rui structure.

#### higher order function

A *higher-order function* is an *original function* that has a function type parameter
annotated with `@Rui`.

#### parameter function

A *parameter function* is a function passed as parameter to a *higher-order function*.

### state variable

A *state variable* is a property of a *component*, part of the *component state*.

#### external state variable

An *external state variable* is a *state variable* that is derived from a parameter of
the *original function*.

#### internal state variable

An *internal state variable* is a *state variable* that is derived from a variable defined
in the body of the *original function*.

#### runtime

The *runtime* is the `hu.simplexion.zakadabar:rui-runime` module. This contains base
classes and interfaces. It is important that this is a "static" runtime, there is no
engine running in the background to perform updates.

### call site

A point in the code where an function is called. Call sites identify the exact points
of function call with the very specific arguments passed to the function at that given call.

### call site dependency mask

A bitmask that contains 1 for each *state variable* the given function call uses in any form: passed
as is, used in a calculation of an argument value, used in the body of a *parameter function*.
This mask is used to decide if the *fragment* has to be patched or not.
